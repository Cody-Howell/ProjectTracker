# ProjectTracker

This project supersedes the previous project [LocalTimeTracker](https://github.com/Cody-Howell/LocalTimeTracker). 
That allowed simple time tracking for general-purpose coding. 

This project enables you to track your projects, keep track of the status of projects, assign scores to a number 
of variables, get and customize a "Work-On" score that's a combination of the scores given and the time 
remaining until the desired date. 

- Track Projects
  - Status of projects
  - Percent complete
  - Scores
    - Professional - How much does it help towards professional development? 
    - Personal - How much is it personally satisfying? 
    - Development - How much does it help develop your skills? 
    - Difficulty - How hard will it be?
  - The above scores and time after Expected Date can be customized in a formula for your needs 
  - Hours expected
  - Type (Library, website, tool, etc.)
  - Expected Date
  - Time spent (time sum of Sessions)
- Sesion Times
  - For each session worked, you can track time using a similar tracker from the LocalTimeTracker.

  - Can have multiple per project
